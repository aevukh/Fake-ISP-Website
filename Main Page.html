      <ul>
        <li>This technological potential has been here the whole time!</li>
        <li>They've been ripping you off with outdated technology and forcibly slow speeds!</li>
        <li>They don't want us to be successful because that means they'll have to give you what they should have been doing this whole time!</li>

    <h2>Why we do what we do</h2> <!-- Explains our mission statement -->
      <p>MXP is primarily interested in helping the lowest among us reach the highest possible potential. <br> We are proud to offer <strong>ALL</strong> of our employees competitive starting salaries, complete with benefits, 401k, and company stock options! <br> This is made possible by those higher on the company tree taking a fair wage, <em>instead</em> of the currently inflated proportion that owners of companies usually give to themselves. <br> We plan to offer free wifi for all, with those of us wanting higher speeds being able to get them with <em>extremely</em> affordable and reasonable pricing. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="third">
    <h2>What this means for you</h2> <!-- The end user -->
      <p>By succeeding in this endeavor, it will mean that everyone is granted access to the internet, which in this day in age should be a human right. It will open up countless opportunities for your means of employment, help with schooling and research for those who need it, and a general boost in the quality of life you get to live, as wherever you go in your city will be connected to free wifi.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="fourth"> <!-- Tells the user what we do (and thanks them) -->
    <h2>How we do what we do</h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>We are able to accomplish all that we do thanks to your continued support, and we are extraordinarily grateful for that.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Technologically speaking, for our free wifi, we make it so that the devices you use to connect to our wifi transmit their own wifi signals to those surrounding you (this does not mean that those around you can see your internet history, nor what you browse). In addition to this, every hookup we have on telephone poles broadcasts their own wifi signal, and they all have the same ip, so you don't have to keep reconnecting to the wifi.</p>
